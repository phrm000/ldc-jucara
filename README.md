# Invisible Roots and Heritage of the Juçara Palm: A Generative Identity

This is the proof of the concept of a generative identity representing the journey of the Euterpe edulis from its perspective within Atlantic Rainforest. From its growth to its interactions with nature and humanity, emphasizing its  role within the ecosystem as well as its cultural and economic significance to the community. Heavily based on the [brush.p5 library](https://github.com/acamposuribe/p5.brush).

The style is based on the current [Invest Paraná VRS](https://vrs.org.br/) art style and scaled to a generative capacity for local artisans to create custom packaging and cards for their products, adding value to their products.
